### Data cleaning
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions:
1. Data Loading and Inspection: It is a large dataset comprising 1,465 rows and 16 columns.
2. Removing unnecessary columns.
3. Applied =proper formula to some columns.
4. Validated the data.
5. Split the category columns to extract key descriptions, facilitating analysis.
6. Finalised the data cleaning by formatting and turning the data set into a table for Pivot Tables.


### Explanatory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the data to answer some questions about the data, such as :
- The number of products per category
- Average discount % by product category
- Average actual price vs the discounted price
- Product with the highest average rating and Product with the highest number of reviews
- Review by Category and the number of products with fewer than 1,000 reviews
